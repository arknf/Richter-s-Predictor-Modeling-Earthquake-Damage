**Richter's Predictor - Modeling Earthquake Damage**

**Based on aspects of building location and construction, your goal is to predict the level of damage to buildings caused by the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal.**

The data was collected through surveys by **Kathmandu Living Labs** and the **Central Bureau of Statistics**, which works under the National Planning Commission Secretariat of Nepal. This survey is one of the largest post-disaster datasets ever collected, containing valuable information on earthquake impacts, household conditions, and socio-economic-demographic statistics.

**Problem description**
We're trying to predict the ordinal variable **damage_grade**, which represents a level of damage to the building that was hit by the earthquake. There are 3 grades of the damage:
  1. 1 represent low damage
  2. 2 represents a medium amount of damage
  3. 3 represents almost complete destruction
